# AutoEncoders
 Implementations of AutoEncoders using PyTorch on simple examples


# MNISTToyAutoEncoder

The project MNISTToyAutoEncoder presents a very simple visualization of the output of an encoder on the MNIST dataset. In this case, the objective consists in compressing the information of the images as much as possible, using a limited number of neurons at the bottleneck of the network
